- ### Powerpoints

	- [Parents First Advising Sample](): This is a powerpoint presentation written for a fictional charity in Cote D'Ivoire that wants to improve their impact on early childhood development. It describes some of the current issues in their monitoring program and advises on practical next steps in targeting data and impact evaluation. It was written as a timed skills-test for Innovations for Poverty Action, so it was completed in just two hours.

  - [Dams of Jordan Social Cohesion and Area Mapping Report]() : This powerpoint presentation describes surveys for location targeting in rural Jordan. The survey was commissioned after violence between community members and refugee cash for workers threatened the viability of GIZ's programming. It was given to GIZ and Jordanian Ministry of Water Staff.
